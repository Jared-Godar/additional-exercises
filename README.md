### Playbook for Practice and Portfolio Building

**What?**

This document is a playbook for practicing problem solving skills while building up your public GitHub portfolio. In addition to being an instructor recommended collection of exercise links, the workflow in this playbook will have you build up your GitHub portfolio with your solutions.

These exercises are suitable for learners to use as practice to keep skills sharp over a holiday break or anytime when folks need more practice and portfolio building!

**So What?**

Solving new exercises and problems makes you a better problem solver.
Adding your exercise directions and solutions to GitHub builds your public portfolio.

Building your portfolio by consistently committing and pushing code, exercises, notes, and projects communicates to potential employers that you are consistent in your work, committed to your craft, and up to stuff! 

**Now What?**


Your Practice and Portfolio Building workflow:

Start with an exercise link from the list below. (recommend starting w/ SQLZoo)

Make a new repository both on GitHub and your local computer. Name this repo “SQLZoo_SQL_Practice_Problems” or similarly named for the other exercise sites.

Make a new .sql file (or .py) in your local repo named after the 1st exercise directions or name it first_exercise.sql, if you are unsure of what to name the file.

Copy the exercise specifications from your browser and paste them as SQL comments in your new .sql file. Add, commit, and push the problem specification in the .sql file.

As you solve the SQL problems in the SQLZoo editor, copy your solution code and paste it into the .sql file that you made locally.

Add, commit, and push your work to GitHub.

Lather, rinse repeat.
